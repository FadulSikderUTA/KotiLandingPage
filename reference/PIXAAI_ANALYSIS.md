# Pixa AI Website Analysis and Recommendations for Koti Landing Page

## 1. Pixa AI Website Analysis

The Pixa AI website features a clean, modern design with a strong emphasis on visual content. The layout is responsive and uses a grid-based system to arrange the cards. The cards themselves are a mix of image-based and solid-color backgrounds, with subtle hover effects that provide visual feedback to the user.

The animations on the Pixa AI website are subtle and used to enhance the user experience. They are not overly complex or distracting. The overall aesthetic is professional and polished, which is a good fit for the Koti landing page.

## 2. Recommendations for Koti Landing Page

Based on my analysis of the Pixa AI website, I have the following recommendations for the Koti landing page:

### 2.1. Page 3: Business Solutions

The following recommendations are specific to the "Business Solutions" section (Page 3) and are designed to be implemented without breaking the existing codebase.

#### Card Styling

*   **Gradients:** I recommend using subtle gradients on the cards to add depth and visual interest. This can be achieved by adding a new set of CSS classes that can be applied to the cards.
*   **Shadows:** I recommend using drop shadows to create a sense of elevation and separation from the background. This can be achieved by adding a new set of CSS classes that can be applied to the cards.
*   **Border Radius:** I recommend using a consistent border-radius for all cards to maintain a cohesive look. This can be achieved by creating a new set of CSS classes that can be applied to the cards.

#### Hover Effects

*   **Scale:** I recommend implementing a subtle scaling effect on hover to provide visual feedback to the user. This can be achieved by adding a new set of CSS classes that can be applied to the cards.
*   **Shadow:** I recommend making the drop shadow more prominent on hover to enhance the sense of elevation. This can be achieved by adding a new set of CSS classes that can be applied to the cards.

#### Typography

*   **Headings:** I recommend using a bold font weight and a larger font size for headings to create a clear visual hierarchy.
*   **Subheadings:** I recommend using a medium font weight and a smaller font size for subheadings.
*   **Body Text:** I recommend using a regular font weight and a standard font size for body text for readability.

### 2.2. Pages 1 and 2

The following recommendations are for Pages 1 and 2 and are designed to be implemented without breaking the existing codebase. These are lower priority than the changes for Page 3.

#### Card Styling

*   **Gradients:** I recommend using subtle gradients on the cards to add depth and visual interest. This can be achieved by adding a new set of CSS classes that can be applied to the cards.
*   **Shadows:** I recommend using drop shadows to create a sense of elevation and separation from the background. This can be achieved by adding a new set of CSS classes that can be applied to the cards.
