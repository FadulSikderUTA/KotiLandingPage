# Kooti Credit Scoring Visualization Redesign Summary

## Completed Changes

1. **Created a Horizontal Navigation Component**
   - Implemented `FrameworkStepsNavigation.tsx` component that displays the framework steps horizontally
   - Added styling for active/completed steps with visual indicators
   - Integrated the component in the header section of the application

2. **Created a Component-Specific Borrower Type Selector**
   - Implemented `BorrowerTypeSelector.tsx` component that encapsulates the borrower type selection UI
   - Designed it to be reusable across different components
   - Made it more compact to fit within component headers

3. **Created Component-Specific UI Components**
   - Implemented `FeatureHierarchy.tsx` for the Feature Hierarchy section in Step 2
   - Implemented `ModelDevelopment.tsx` for the Model Development section in Step 3
   - Implemented `ScoreCalculation.tsx` for the Score Calculation section in Step 3
   - Implemented `FeatureWeightDistribution.tsx` for the Feature Weight Distribution section in Step 3
   - Each component includes its own borrower type selector

## Implementation Status

The redesign is fully implemented with the following components:

- ✅ Created the `FrameworkStepsNavigation` component
- ✅ Created the `BorrowerTypeSelector` component
- ✅ Created the `FeatureHierarchy` component
- ✅ Created the `ModelDevelopment` component
- ✅ Created the `ScoreCalculation` component
- ✅ Created the `FeatureWeightDistribution` component

## Integration Steps

The following steps are needed to integrate the components into the main application:

1. **Import the Components**
   - Import all the created components in the main file
   - Pass the necessary props to each component

2. **Replace Existing Code**
   - Replace the left sidebar with the horizontal navigation
   - Replace the existing feature hierarchy, model development, score calculation, and feature weight distribution sections with the new components
   - Remove the global borrower type selector

3. **Test the Application**
   - Run the application and verify that the horizontal navigation works correctly
   - Test the borrower type selectors in each component to ensure they update the state correctly
   - Check that the UI is responsive and looks good on different screen sizes

## Technical Notes

- Each component is designed to be self-contained and reusable
- The components use the global `borrowerType` state and `setBorrowerType` function
- The horizontal navigation uses the global `activeStep` state and `setActiveStep` function
- The components are styled consistently with the existing design
- Detailed integration instructions are provided in the `implementation_guide.md` file
