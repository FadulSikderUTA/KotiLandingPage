## 1.1 Introduction to Credit Scoring Methodologies

Credit scoring is a **statistical methodology** used to evaluate a borrower’s creditworthiness by predicting the probability of default on financial obligations. By transforming historical performance data and borrower characteristics into predictive models, credit scoring provides **objective, consistent, and quantifiable** measures of credit risk. This process is vital for financial institutions to:

- **Improve Lending Decisions**: By quantifying default risk, lenders can **price credit more accurately**, reduce defaults, and broaden lending opportunities to suitable borrowers.
- **Streamline Credit Processes**: Automated credit scoring **speeds up** loan approvals, cutting costs and removing subjectivity from underwriting.
- **Facilitate Financial Inclusion**: Robust scoring **expands credit access** to consumers or small businesses lacking traditional collateral, which is critical in emerging economies like Bangladesh.
- **Enhance Market Efficiency**: Reliable credit scoring **reduces information asymmetry**, encouraging competition and lower interest rates for responsible borrowers.

In Bangladesh’s developing financial ecosystem, a properly calibrated credit scoring system can be a game-changer, **improving financial stability** by identifying high-risk borrowers more effectively, and **increasing financial inclusion** by recognizing low-risk borrowers previously overlooked due to inadequate formal credit histories.

Credit bureaus are central to this effort. By **aggregating credit information** from multiple sources (banks, NBFIs, MFIs, utilities, telecoms, etc.), they **create standardized risk assessments** accessible to lenders. With oversight from Bangladesh Bank, this consolidated approach **lowers systemic risk** and fosters a healthier credit market.

However, Bangladesh’s diverse landscape—low banking penetration, **prevalence of microfinance**, large underbanked segments—means a purely “Western” model cannot be adopted verbatim. Instead, a **localized credit scoring framework** must incorporate both traditional and alternative data, handle thin-file and thick-file borrowers distinctly, and comply with **Bangladesh Bank’s regulatory guidelines** on licensing and operating a credit bureau.

## 1.2 Key Terminologies and Definitions

Below are essential credit scoring terms and concepts referenced throughout this methodology. While each has a rigorous statistical basis, we also provide **plain-language explanations** for clarity.

1. **Probability of Default (PD)**
    - **Definition**: The likelihood (ranging from 0 to 1) that a borrower will fail to meet credit obligations within a defined time horizon.
    - **Relevance**: PD is the core output of most credit scoring models, helping lenders quantify risk in monetary terms.
2. **Weight of Evidence (WoE)**
    - **Notation**: WoE=ln⁡(% Good% Bad)\text{WoE} = \ln\left(\frac{\% \text{ Good}}{\% \text{ Bad}} \right)
    - **Purpose**: Converts categorical or binned numerical variables into continuous scales that **preserve** their predictive relationships.
    - **Benefit**: Promotes **monotonic** relationships with default probability, simplifying model fitting.
3. **Information Value (IV)**
    - **Formula**: IV=∑i=1n(%Goodi−%Badi)×ln⁡(%Goodi%Badi) \text{IV} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \bigl(\% \text{Good}_i - \% \text{Bad}_i\bigr) \times \ln\Bigl(\frac{\% \text{Good}_i}{\% \text{Bad}_i}\Bigr)
    - **Interpretation**: Gauges how much a variable **discriminates** between good and bad borrowers:
        - IV < 0.02 = Weak predictor
        - 0.02–0.1 = Moderate
        - 0.1–0.3 = Strong
        - 0.3+ = Very Strong
    - **Use**: Helps prioritize features for model inclusion.
4. **Gini Coefficient**
    - **Definition**: A **discrimination** metric ranging from 0 to 1, derived from the **Area Under the ROC Curve** (AUC). Calculated as: Gini=2×AUC−1 \text{Gini} = 2 \times \text{AUC} - 1
    - **Meaning**: The higher the Gini, the better the model **separates** good vs. bad borrowers. E.g., Gini above 0.4 is generally considered good.
5. **Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) Statistic**
    - **Definition**: The maximum separation between cumulative distributions of good and bad borrowers.
    - **Interpretation**: Higher KS = better separation. Values typically range from 0.2 (weak) to 0.6 (excellent).
6. **Points to Double Odds (PDO)**
    - **Concept**: A scaling factor telling how many score points correspond to a **doubling** in the odds (non-default odds) of a borrower. Commonly 20 or 40 points per doubling of odds.
    - **Usage**: Used in scorecard design to maintain consistent incremental changes in PD as the score changes.
7. **Thick-File vs. Thin-File Borrowers**
    - **Thick-File**: Borrowers with **substantial** credit history (multiple tradelines, 2+ years of data). Typically scored using mainstream credit variables (payment history, utilization, length of history).
    - **Thin-File**: Borrowers with **limited or no** formal credit record. Requires **alternative data** approaches (utility, telecom, MFS usage) to assess risk.
8. **Scorecard**
    - **Definition**: A point-based system derived from a logistic regression model. Each attribute (bin) is assigned points reflecting its risk contribution. Summing points yields a final score.
    - **Benefit**: Highly interpretable, easy for lenders to implement, widely accepted by regulators.
9. **Model Validation Metrics**
    - **Discrimination**: Gini, KS, AUC-ROC.
    - **Calibration**: Hosmer-Lemeshow test, Brier Score.
    - **Stability**: Population Stability Index (PSI).
    - **Interpretation**: Each metric checks a different aspect (accuracy, reliability, data shifts, etc.).
10. **Psychometric Assessment**
    - **Definition**: Measuring personality traits and behaviors (e.g., conscientiousness, responsibility) that correlate with repayment.
    - **Relevance**: Especially valuable for thin-file borrowers, supplementing limited financial data with behavioral indicators.

These terms form the **technical backbone** of this credit scoring methodology. Regulators, financial institutions, and other stakeholders in Bangladesh can reference them to understand how each concept contributes to a robust, **compliant**, and **transparent** credit scoring system.

## 1.3 Historical Evolution of Credit Scoring

Modern credit scoring traces its roots to the mid-20th century, evolving through several pivotal stages:

1. **Early Statistical Approaches (1950s-1960s)**
    - Bill Fair and Earl Isaac pioneered application scorecards to evaluate loan applicants.
    - Simple discriminant analyses used personal attributes to separate “good” vs. “bad” risks.
2. **Formalization of Credit Bureaus (1970s-1980s)**
    - Credit bureaus emerged to **centralize** credit data from banks and lenders.
    - Scoring models expanded to **behavior scorecards** for monitoring on-book accounts.
    - Logistic regression replaced simpler methods, providing **direct** PD estimation.
3. **Mainstream Adoption & Automation (1990s-2000s)**
    - Widespread use of FICO scores in consumer credit (US) and similar models globally.
    - Growth in data availability improved model accuracy; partial rollouts in emerging markets.
    - Regulators recognized the value in **objective, data-driven** credit decisions.
4. **Rise of Alternative Data & ML (2000s-Present)**
    - Emerging markets began leveraging phone records, utility payments, e-commerce footprints.
    - Machine learning advanced scoring sophistication, capturing **complex patterns** beyond linear relationships.
    - Fintech lenders adopted real-time, **digital-first** scoring for microloans and small businesses.
5. **Transition to Inclusive Scoring in Developing Countries**
    - Regulators in places like Kenya, India, and the Philippines pushed for **alternative data integration** to serve unbanked populations.
    - Introduction of **psychometric** and **behavioral** scoring to fill gaps in formal credit records.
    - A heavy emphasis on **financial inclusion** spurred innovation in scoring segments historically ignored by conventional credit systems.

In Bangladesh, prior credit bureau efforts focused on **negative-only** databases or limited coverage. The emerging approach merges **positive and negative** data, **alternative data**, and **machine learning** techniques. Kooti Credit Bureau’s methodology thus leverages global lessons but **adapts** to local realities: low credit penetration, a strong microfinance sector, and a **large unbanked** population needing **thin-file** solutions.

---

## 1.4 Kooti Credit Bureau Scoring Framework

The proposed Kooti scoring framework comprises:

1. **General-Purpose vs. Application-Specific Models**
    - **General-Purpose (Kooti Score)**: Provides an overall risk assessment for any credit product, ensuring **consistent** underwriting across multiple lenders and **reducing** data asymmetry.
    - **Application-Specific (custom lender models)**: Developed internally by banks/NBFIs for particular credit products. Kooti Score often serves as a **baseline** or input to such specialized models.
2. **Kooti Score as the Central Engine**
    - Kooti’s default **Kooti Score**  measures overall creditworthiness using logistic regression, specialized for the **Bangladesh** environment.
    - The score uses a **300–850** scale, with higher scores indicating lower default risk.
3. **Dual-Model Segmentation**
    - **Kooti Pro Score**: For “thick-file” borrowers with multiple credit lines and a credit history of at least 2+ years. Relies heavily on **traditional data**—payment history, outstanding debt, credit tenure, etc.
    - **Kooti New Score**: For “thin-file” or “no-file” individuals using **alternative data** (e.g., telecom bills, utility, MFS) plus any partial credit info available. Incorporates **machine learning** and possibly **psychometric** signals for deeper predictive power.
4. **Industry-Specific Adaptations**
    
    - The Kooti scoring engine can yield specialized variants:
        - **Kooti MFI Score**: Microfinance-oriented, capturing group lending nuances.
        - **Kooti Retail Score**: For consumer retail credit, emphasizing short-term purchase financing.
        - **Kooti SME Score**: Tailored to small business data and cash-flow cycles.
    - Each variant still **aligns** with the core Kooti Score structure, ensuring **methodological consistency**.
5. **Challenges Addressed in Bangladesh**
    
    - **Low Credit Adoption**: Scores must effectively handle sparse data for the majority who lack formal loans.
    - **Thin-File Population**: Alternative data is crucial to reliably identify creditworthy borrowers.
    - **Regulatory Environment**: Must comply with Bangladesh Bank’s guidelines on bureau licensing, permissible data usage, and consumer protection.
    - **Microfinance Prevalence**: Many rely on microfinance; the scoring must incorporate MFI repayment patterns.
    - **Data Scarcity**: Some borrowers have short or uneven credit histories, requiring more robust data integration and psychometric or behavior-based approaches.

By systematically addressing these elements—**dual segmentation**, **data integration**, **machine learning enhancements**, and **Bangladesh-specific** challenges—Kooti aims to **expand credit access responsibly** while reinforcing **risk management**. This scoring system becomes a cornerstone of the country’s financial infrastructure, promoting **inclusion, stability,** and **growth**.

This end-to-end process ensures a **systematic** approach that is fully auditable, transparent, and flexible enough to handle **Bangladesh’s mixed data environment**—from robust credit histories in urban centers to limited-data borrowers in rural areas.

---

## 2.2 Differentiated Approaches by Segment

While the overarching methodology remains consistent, Kooti tailors certain steps for the **Pro Score** versus the **New Score** segments:

1. **Data Collection & Feature Engineering**
    
    - **Pro Score**: Emphasizes formal loan performance data, credit cards, installment loans, and potentially more advanced variables (e.g., credit line usage patterns).
    - **New Score**: Focuses on alternative data (utility bills, telecom usage, mobile wallet transactions). May incorporate **psychometric assessments** to bolster predictiveness.
2. **Outcome Definition**
    
    - **Pro Score**: Typically sets a 12-month performance window with a well-documented historical record.
    - **New Score**: May adopt a shorter (6–12 months) performance window, given less data availability, with heavier reliance on **recent** payment patterns in alternative data.
3. **Model Development**
    
    - **Pro Score**: Relies primarily on logistic regression with minimal non-linear transformations.
    - **New Score**: Uses a **hybrid** approach, integrating ML-based feature engineering or even ensemble methods, given the limited formal credit data.
4. **Validation & Monitoring**
    
    - **Pro Score**: Richer historical data allows for more **robust** out-of-time testing, plus stable Gini/KS metrics over multiple years.
    - **New Score**: Requires **frequent recalibration** as alternative data sources mature and the underbanked segment evolves in credit usage.

Overall, **both** paths follow the **five-step model** (Objectives → Target → Data → Development/Validation → Implementation/Monitoring). This ensures a coherent approach across segments while acknowledging their fundamentally different data contexts.

# Section 4: Specify Target & Outcome Definition

---

## 4.1 Credit Risk Target Definition

Credit scoring fundamentally revolves around predicting the **likelihood of default**. A precise definition of default and a suitable performance period (when default is observed) are pivotal to generating an accurate credit score. This section outlines Kooti Credit Bureau’s approach to defining the target variable and its relevance in the Bangladesh context, ensuring compliance with **Bangladesh Bank** directives and **global best practices**.

### 4.1.1 Primary Target Variable: Probability of Default (PD)

Kooti’s central target variable is the **Probability of Default (PD)** over a defined time horizon—most commonly **12 months**. This aligns with the standard approach used in both **Basel regulatory frameworks** and widespread industry practice.

1. **Core Definition**
    
    PD=P(Borrower defaults within the next 12 months).\mathrm{PD} = P(\text{Borrower defaults within the next 12 months}).
    
    A borrower is considered _in default_ if they are unable or unwilling to meet debt obligations in a timely manner, typically marked by **90+ days** past due, or another serious derogatory event (e.g., bankruptcy, loan write-off).
    
2. **Why 12 Months?**
    
    - Aligns with many lender cycles and regulatory norms.
    - Offers a balance between capturing mid-term credit risk signals and manageable data collection windows.
    - Matches standard capital adequacy assessments (e.g., Basel requirements).
3. **Regulatory Alignment**
    
    - Bangladesh Bank’s guidelines (Sections 3.3 & 11.4) emphasize proper, transparent default definitions.
    - Kooti’s PD measure maps directly to formal delinquency statuses (30/60/90 days) as well as any **significant negative credit event**.

### 4.1.2 Standard Industry Default Definitions

In line with **international credit bureau** conventions, Kooti recognizes multiple expressions of default:

- **90+ Days Past Due**  
    A widely accepted threshold for “seriously delinquent,” often a trigger point for default classification.
- **Charge-Off/Write-Off**  
    When an account is declared uncollectible by the lender, effectively acknowledging a loss.
- **Bankruptcy or Insolvency**  
    If a borrower has legally declared inability to repay debts.
- **Settlements**  
    Partial repayment arrangements indicating elevated risk, often classified under negative events.

**Reference**: Sections 3.2.1 and 3.2.4 of the Bangladesh Bank guidelines discuss formal definitions for non-performing loans and the importance of consistent classification across lenders.

### 4.1.3 Alternative Target Constructions

While **90+ days past due** serves as our principal definition, Kooti supports nuanced target definitions depending on the modeling purpose:

1. **Delinquency-Based Thresholds**
    
    - _30+ Days Past Due_: Early warning signals.
    - _60+ Days_: Intermediate delinquency.
    - _120+ Days_: Extended or severe delinquency.
2. **Roll Rate Analysis**
    
    - Evaluates the probability of moving from one delinquency bucket to a worse state (e.g., 30→60, 60→90).
    - Particularly valuable for short-tenor loans or microfinance products.
3. **Vintage Analysis**
    
    - Groups loans/origination cohorts by “vintage” and tracks performance over time.
    - Offers macro insights into underwriting shifts or economic impacts.

In practice, these target variations often feed back into the **Kooti Pro Score** (thick-file) or **Kooti New Score** (thin-file) calibration. For official Kooti Score usage, we standardize on **12-month PD** anchored on **90+ days** or a major derogatory event.

---

## 4.2 Segmented Target Strategy

Kooti’s scoring methodology envisions **two distinct borrower segments**—thick-file and thin-file—requiring tailored target definitions reflecting their data availability and credit behaviors.

### 4.2.1 Thick-File Segment: Kooti Pro Score Target

**Formal Credit Data Focus**  
For borrowers with established credit histories, we leverage conventional metrics:

1. **Default Definition**
    
    - 90+ day delinquency on **any** recognized account.
    - Past charge-offs, write-downs, or adverse statuses within the performance window.
2. **Observation & Performance Windows**
    
    - Typical _observation period_: up to 24 months of historical credit behavior.
    - _Performance window_: 12 months following the observation period, capturing future defaults.
3. **Data Requirements**
    
    - At least one active account >6 months old.
    - Multiple credit lines if possible (credit card, personal loan, etc.).
    - Enough continuity in the bureau’s data to track changes over time.
4. **Why This Works**
    
    - Borrowers often have multiple accounts with well-documented payment patterns.
    - Longer history => more reliable detection of risk signals.

### 4.2.2 Thin-File Segment: Kooti New Score Target

**Alternative Data Emphasis**  
For borrowers with minimal or no formal credit footprint, we redefine default to incorporate non-traditional payment performance.

1. **Adapted Default Definition**
    - 90+ day delinquency OR equivalent negative event in alternative channels, e.g.:
        - Utility bills not paid for 2–3 consecutive cycles, leading to disconnection.
        - Multiple missed postpaid phone bills.
        - High severity mobile money loan defaults.
2. **Flexible Windows**
    - Typically, a shorter _observation window_ (6–12 months) due to sparse data.
    - The same 12-month _performance window_ but with more frequent updates, as data arrives from telco or MFS partners.
3. **Data Availability**
    - Telecom usage patterns, utility payment timelines, MFS transaction flows, small-scale microfinance activity.
    - Some borrowers may only have partial alternative data, prompting conservative PD estimation.
4. **Added ML Approaches**
    - More sophisticated detection of “early negative signals.”
    - E.g., dropping top-up frequency might predict future payment disruptions.

**Note**: Psychometric scores might supplement these definitions. A borrower failing _psychometric thresholds_ could be flagged at high risk, effectively paralleling a default-like event if validations confirm strong correlation.

---

## 4.3 Observation and Performance Windows

### 4.3.1 Time Window Framework

Selecting consistent time windows ensures reliable model training:

1. **Observation Window**
    - Period during which borrower attributes are measured.
    - For thick-file: up to 24 months. For thin-file: 6–12 months.
    - Captures payment behaviors, credit usage, alternative data signals.
2. **Exclusion/Buffer Window**
    - Gap (e.g., 0–3 months) between observation and performance windows.
    - Prevents “data leakage,” ensuring the model does not see outcomes it’s trying to predict.
3. **Performance Window**
    
    - Future horizon (typically 12 months) to observe default events.
    - Aligns with a standard PD measure.

**Illustrative Timeline**:

```
Observation Window (up to 24m for thick-file) --> Exclusion (3m) --> Performance Window (12m)
```

Thin-file might shorten the observation period but still retains a 12-month forward performance check if feasible.

### 4.3.2 Calibration for Bangladesh Market

Bangladesh’s credit cycles often differ from developed markets. Some nuances:

- **Short-Tenor Loans**: Many microfinance or SME loans revolve in 6–9 months.
- **Agricultural Seasonality**: Income timing heavily influences repayment capacity.
- **Data Gaps**: Inconsistent reporting from some smaller lenders may hamper 24-month histories.

Hence, Kooti designs flexible windows, evaluating:

- **Minimum Observations**: A borrower’s data must have 3+ months of active records for any meaningful modeling.
- **Seasonal Coverage**: If a borrower is in agriculture, the observation window tries to capture both peak and off-peak seasons.
- **Validation Against Real Outcomes**: Multiple back-testing cycles confirm that 12 months forward observation is a stable measure for local default patterns.

### 4.3.3 Economic Cycle Coverage

To ensure the model is robust:

- **Out-of-Time Validation**: Regularly train on earlier years (e.g., 2020–2021) and validate on more recent years (e.g., 2022–2023) to check if PD predictions hold up across economic changes.
- **Stress Events**: Incorporate data from flood-affected or pandemic-affected periods if available to test model resilience.
- **Macro Monitoring**: Kooti’s governance includes monitoring large macro shifts—e.g., inflation spikes, sudden currency changes—to adjust performance windows if default patterns shift drastically.

# Section 5: Data Collection & Feature Engineering

---

A robust credit scoring model depends critically on **comprehensive, high-quality data** and well-designed feature engineering. This section outlines the Kooti Credit Bureau strategy for **collecting**, **validating**, and **transforming** both **traditional** and **alternative** credit data in Bangladesh. It also addresses processes for **data quality management**, **missing value treatment**, and **feature selection**, ensuring compliance with Bangladesh Bank guidelines ([Section 11.4 - Data Sources and Management](https://chatgpt.com/c/67d6d208-ad04-8010-a4b8-afedda173fb1?model=o1-pro#dummy)) and alignment with global best practices.

---

## 5.1 Data Collection Strategy

### 5.1.1 Credit-Specific Data Sources

Kooti integrates two broad categories of data: **traditional financial** and **alternative**. This dual approach guarantees maximum coverage across Bangladesh’s diverse credit market, from well-established bank clients (thick-file) to underbanked individuals (thin-file).

1. **Traditional Financial Data**
    
    - **Banks and Financial Institutions**  
        - Loan histories (origination date, repayment schedules, outstanding balances, delinquency records)  
        - Credit facilities (credit cards, overdrafts, secured/unsecured loans)  
        - Repayment performance, including historical late/missed payments  
        - Relationship info (account tenure, type of products)
    - **Bangladesh Bank Credit Information Bureau (CIB)**  
        - Existing credit registry data on outstanding loans, classification statuses, defaults  
        - Cross-institution exposure info  
        - Particularly relevant for thick-file borrowers with multi-institution footprints
    - **Microfinance Institutions (MFIs)**  
        - Small loan histories, group-lending performance  
        - Weekly/bi-weekly repayment patterns  
        - Cumulative borrowings across MFIs (if reporting is consistent)  
        - **Note**: Large swaths of rural borrowers rely on MFIs first before formal banking
    - **Insurance Companies**  
        - Premium payments, policy statuses  
        - Lapse or surrender patterns  
        - Potential correlation with responsible financial behavior
2. **Alternative Data Sources**
    
    - **Utility Companies**  
        - Electricity, water, gas payment histories  
        - Timeliness, disconnection events, reconnection timelines  
        - Service tenure reflecting residential stability
    - **Telecommunications Providers**  
        - Mobile phone usage (postpaid bills, top-up frequency, service continuity)  
        - Payment reliability (late or partial payments)  
        - Prepaid patterns as proxies for income stability
    - **Mobile Financial Services (MFS)**  
        - Transaction volumes (cash-in, cash-out, P2P transfers)  
        - Merchant payments, bill payments via wallet  
        - Micro-loans or BNPL (buy now, pay later) within MFS ecosystems  
        - Potential for capturing consumer behaviors in near real time
    - **E-commerce and Digital Platforms** _(Future Integration)_  
        - Purchase and repayment patterns on online marketplaces  
        - Return behaviors, partial payment methods  
        - Typically introduced once basic frameworks with telco/MFS are stable
    - **Psychometric Data** _(If permitted and validated)_  
        - Behavioral quizzes measuring responsibility, risk tolerance, conscientiousness  
        - Verified only if strong correlation with repayment emerges

> **Disclaimer**: Actual partnerships and data flows will be finalized during implementation, subject to Bangladesh Bank approvals, data provider agreements, and proven data quality.

---

### 5.1.2 Data Acquisition Methods

1. **Real-Time API Integration**
    - **REST** or **SOAP** endpoints from major institutions (banks, telcos)
    - **OAuth 2.0** or token-based authentication for secure data pulls
    - **Immediate** updates on new defaults, opened accounts
2. **Secure Batch Processing**
    - **SFTP/FTPS** for scheduled file deliveries (daily, weekly, monthly)
    - **PGP encryption** for in-transit data security
    - Standardized CSV/XML formats aligned with Kooti’s data schema
3. **Encrypted File Transfer Protocols**
    - End-to-end encryption ensures privacy
    - **Digital signatures** to verify authenticity of data providers
    - **Audit trails** of all data submissions for regulatory compliance
4. **Web Portals for Smaller Providers**
    - Online forms or upload portals for microfinance or smaller institutions
    - Validation scripts to ensure data completeness
    - Bulk upload features for aggregated monthly or quarterly data

**Refresh Frequency** depends on each provider’s operational cadence. _Telecom data_, for example, could be weekly, while _CIB_ updates might be monthly. The final schedule balances the need for freshness against operational overhead.

---

### 5.1.3 Segmented Data Strategy

#### Kooti Pro Score Data Focus

For **thick-file** borrowers, reliability and depth of **traditional credit data** is paramount:
- **Loan-level detail** from banks
- **Detailed repayment history** (≥ 24 months if possible)
- **More advanced** data points like credit utilization, multiple trade lines, credit limit changes

This granular data yields strong signals on long-standing credit management behaviors.

#### Kooti New Score Data Focus

For **thin-file** segments, **alternative data** is critical:
- **Mobile phone** payment patterns or top-up frequency to infer financial discipline
- **Utility** records tracking bill payment regularity
- **MFS** usage signifying digital financial maturity
- **Psychometric** data (if validated) capturing behavioral risk insights

**Priority** is breadth of data sources rather than depth, focusing on capturing at least some reliable payment patterns.

    > _Actual data source integration will vary based on provider readiness, regulatory approval, and data quality compliance. Figure is illustrative of the planned ecosystem._

## 5.2 Credit Data Quality Management

Quality control is essential to ensure accurate scoring. Kooti implements a **data quality framework** that addresses missing data, outliers, and standardization, complying with **Section 11.7** of Bangladesh Bank guidelines on data accuracy.

### 5.2.1 Data Quality Framework

#### Missing Data Identification & Handling
1. **Classification of Missing**:
    - **MCAR** (Missing Completely at Random)
    - **MAR** (Missing at Random)
    - **MNAR** (Missing Not at Random)  
        > The difference influences whether simple or complex imputation is feasible.
2. **Zero-Value Handling**:
    - Must distinguish actual “0” from a placeholder “missing.”
    - Zeros are **never** used as default imputations for missing, preventing interpretational bias.
3. **Imputation Techniques**:
    - **Mean/Median** for numeric (if truly MCAR).
    - **KNN Imputation** for synergy with correlated variables.
    - **Categorical**: Mode or “missing” bin creation.
    - For large coverage gaps, credit bureau might designate a special code (e.g., “Unverified”).

#### Outlier Detection & Treatment
1. **Statistical Approaches**:
    - **Z-scores** or **IQR** to identify extreme values.
    - **Boxplot** inspection for distribution anomalies.
2. **Handling**:
    - **Capping** at 99th percentile (or appropriate threshold).
    - **Winsorization** for extremely skewed distributions.
    - **Log transformations** if numeric outliers are drastically large.
3. **Illustration**:
    - “Annual Income” extremes or “Credit Card Utilization” >500% might indicate data errors or unrealistic entries.

#### Data Consistency & Validation
1. **Cross-field Checks**:
    - E.g., “If account is closed, outstanding balance must be 0.”
    - E.g., “Payment amount can’t exceed current balance + fees.”
2. **Range Checks**:
    - Hard-coded boundaries for numeric fields.
    - E.g., credit limit must be ≥ 0.
3. **Data Dictionary**:
    - Standard definitions: e.g., “status code,” “delinquency bucket.”
    - Minimizes confusion across multiple providers.

#### Handling Special Values (Zeros, Negatives)

- Zero might be a real balance or a placeholder. Must be carefully distinguished.
- Negative balances sometimes appear (overdraft, refunds). Kooti flags these for manual or advanced check if suspicious.

### 5.2.2 Missing Data Treatment
1. **Analysis of Missing Mechanisms**
    - If we see patterns that poor data coverage correlates with higher default risk, “missingness” itself can become a predictor (MNAR).
2. **Imputation vs. Exclusion**
    - **Thin-file** often uses every data piece, so dropping records is rarely feasible.
    - For thick-file, if a borrower’s records are incomplete beyond a threshold, that might degrade the reliability enough to exclude or label “insufficient data.”
3. **Imputation Method Selection**
    - **KNN** might yield better fill for correlated variables.
    - **Regression**-based if a strong predictor is highly correlated with the missing variable.
    - **Mode** for missing categorical data in short files.
    - For risky or heavily MNAR contexts, assign “unknown” category or partial penalty points.

### 5.2.3 Data Standardization & Integration

**Preprocessing** ensures consistent reporting across all data providers:
- **Name/Address Normalization**: Using fuzzy matching to unify records for the same individual.
- **Date Format Harmonization**: Ensuring e.g., DD-MM-YYYY or ISO 8601.
- **Code Harmonization**: Mapping each provider’s internal codes (like “X5 – Written-off”) to the bureau’s standard classification.
- **Temporal Alignment**: Ensuring that all data points can be matched to monthly or quarterly snapshots if necessary.

**Identity Resolution** is critical:
- NID (National ID) used as **primary key** when available.
- Fallback to phone number or other reference if partial data.
- Confidence scoring for matched vs. uncertain identity merges.

## 5.3 Feature Creation & Selection

After ensuring data is accurate and complete, **feature engineering** transforms raw inputs into powerful predictive signals. Kooti’s approach systematically identifies which variables are most relevant to default risk in the Bangladesh context.

### 5.3.1 Credit-Relevant Feature Hierarchy

Industry experience suggests weighting categories similarly to global scoring frameworks (like FICO). We adapt them to local reality:

1. **Payment History Features** (~35% Weight in traditional models)
    - Delinquency metrics (counts, recency, severity)
    - Past defaults or written-offs
    - On-time payment proportions
2. **Credit Utilization Features** (~30% Weight in traditional models)
    - Utilization ratio (balance vs. limit)
    - High usage flags (maxed out)
    - Trends in usage (increasing or decreasing)
3. **Credit History Length** (~15% Weight in traditional models)
    - Age of oldest account
    - Average account age
    - Recency of newest account
4. **Credit Mix** (~10% Weight in traditional models)
    - Types of credit used (secured/unsecured, MFI vs. bank)
    - Experience with multiple products (revolving, installment, etc.)
5. **New Credit Behavior** (~10% Weight in traditional models)
    - Recent hard inquiries
    - Newly opened accounts
    - “Credit shopping” patterns
6. **Alternative Data** (Primarily for Thin-File)
    - Utility bill timeliness
    - Telecom top-up consistency or postpaid on-time rate
    - MFS usage depth (frequency, amounts)
    - Psychometric test outcomes

### 5.3.2 Positive vs. Negative Information

Bangladesh Bank guidelines (Section 3.4) require capturing both **positive** and **negative** aspects. For example:

|Feature|Positive Info|Negative Info|
|---|---|---|
|Payment History|No late payments, prompt settlements, never defaulted|Late payments (30/60/90+), missed installments, defaults, bankruptcies|
|Credit Utilization|Low usage (below 30%), stable balances|Maxed-out cards, spiking balances, over-limit usage|
|History Length|Long-standing accounts, stable relationships|Short or newly opened accounts, frequent closures|
|Credit Mix|Diverse credit (secured, credit cards, MFS)|Only short-term unsecured or high-risk product usage|
|New Credit|Measured approach, limited inquiries|Excessive inquiries or multiple new accounts in short time|
|Alternative Data|Consistent utility/telecom payments, robust MFS usage|Utility disconnections, frequent telecom service suspensions, negative MFS events|

---

### 5.3.3 Statistical Variable Selection Methods

Kooti uses recognized analytical techniques to determine which features truly predict default risk.

1. **Information Value (IV)**
    - **Definition**: IV=∑i=1n((%Gi−%Bi)×ln⁡%Gi%Bi) \mathrm{IV} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \Big((\%G_i - \%B_i) \times \ln \frac{\%G_i}{\%B_i}\Big) Where %Gi\%G_i and %Bi\%B_i are proportions of good vs. bad borrowers in bin ii.
    - **Interpretation**: Higher IV => stronger predictive power.
2. **Weight of Evidence (WoE)**
    - **Definition**: WoEi=ln⁡(%Gi%Bi) \mathrm{WoE}_i = \ln\Big(\frac{\%G_i}{\%B_i}\Big)
    - **Monotonic** relationships with outcome => easier logistic regression modeling.
3. **Correlation Analysis**
    - **Pearson / Cramer’s V** for numeric vs. categorical.
    - Identify highly correlated variables, reducing redundancy.
4. **Stepwise Selection**
    - Forward / backward elimination based on significance or improvement in AIC/BIC.
    - Kooti might integrate domain knowledge to override purely statistical decisions if a variable is known to be important (e.g., microfinance delinquency).
5. **Multicollinearity Checks**
    - **Variance Inflation Factor (VIF)** to ensure no instability in coefficients.
    - If VIF>10, consider dropping or combining correlated features.

### 5.3.4 Business Logic Integration

**Regulatory and ethical** constraints guide final feature inclusion:

- No **discriminatory** variables (e.g., religion, ethnicity).
- Must **explain** each variable’s relevance to default risk.
- If a variable creates hidden biases, we remove or adjust.
- Certain domain-known variables (like “# of micro-loans repaid successfully”) might be included even if initial IV is moderate—especially vital for rural Bangladesh segments.

# Section 6: Model Development & Validation

Building on the data collection and feature engineering framework from Section 5, we now discuss how Kooti Credit Bureau **develops** and **validates** its credit scoring models. This encompasses **algorithm selection**, **model training**, **testing**, and the creation of user-friendly **scorecards**. Throughout this section, we distinguish between the **thick-file** model (“Kooti Pro Score”) and the **thin-file** model (“Kooti New Score”), highlighting where methodological enhancements are needed to handle sparse data.

---

## 6.1 Algorithm Selection Strategy

Kooti Credit Bureau adopts a **dual model** approach: logistic regression as the **primary** technique, enhanced by select **machine learning** insights to capture non-linear patterns—especially relevant for thin-file borrowers. This aligns with global best practices, balancing **predictive power**, **interpretability**, and **regulatory compliance**.

---

### 6.1.1 Primary Modeling Approach: Logistic Regression

#### Rationale and Core Formulations

Logistic regression remains the **backbone** of credit scoring globally due to its:

1. **Interpretability**: Model coefficients directly map to log-odds of default—a transparent, regulator-friendly representation.
2. **Industry Standard**: Decades of usage in major bureau scores (e.g., FICO, Experian).
3. **Scorecard Transformation**: Straightforward mapping from logistic outputs to a points-based system.
4. **Alignment with Bangladesh Bank**: Regulators typically favor models with clear decision factors.

**Mathematically**, logistic regression models the probability of default (P(Default)P(\text{Default})) as:

$$P(Default ⁣∣X)  =  11+e−(β0+∑i=1pβiXi)P(\text{Default}\!\mid X) \;=\; \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(\beta_0 + \sum_{i=1}^{p}\beta_i X_i )}}$$

where β0\beta_0 is the intercept, βi\beta_i are coefficients, and XiX_i are the input variables (often in Weight of Evidence form). The **logit** (log-odds) is linear:

$$ln⁡ ⁣(P(Default ⁣∣X)1−P(Default ⁣∣X))  =  β0+β1X1+⋯+βpXp.\ln\!\Big(\frac{P(\text{Default}\!\mid X)}{1 - P(\text{Default}\!\mid X)}\Big) \;=\; \beta_0 + \beta_1X_1 + \dots + \beta_pX_p .$$

**Advantages** for the Bangladesh context:

- **Well-understood** by local and international regulators.
- **Scalable** for large borrower bases.
- **Stable**: Less prone to overfitting than many black-box ML models.

> **Note**: Actual coefficients βi\beta_i will be derived from local data once the bureau is fully operational and has a robust sample of borrower performance records.

---

### 6.1.2 Machine Learning Enhancement Strategy

While logistic regression is the **foundation**, Kooti employs a “**Model Lifting**” approach where advanced ML techniques provide incremental improvements:

#### Definition: Model Lifting

- Integrating ML-based insights—e.g., non-linear interactions, specialized variable transformations—back into a logistic model.
- Preserves logistic regression’s interpretability while leveraging ML’s deeper pattern recognition.

#### ML Tools Used

1. **Decision Trees**
    - Identify interactions between variables (e.g., “high utilization AND multiple inquiries”).
    - Proposed interactions can be coded explicitly into logistic bins.
2. **Random Forests**
    - Serve as a **benchmark** for maximum feasible AUC/Gini.
    - Provide variable-importance rankings that might highlight overlooked features.
3. **Gradient Boosting**
    - Pinpoints subtle data patterns, especially in thin-file contexts.
    - Uncovers partial dependence insights used to design new logistic features.
4. **Neural Networks** (potential future usage)
    - Explores complex non-linearity, though interpretability remains a challenge.
    - Possibly suited for alternative data streams (e.g., MFS transaction logs).

**Implementation**:

1. Train baseline logistic regression on selected features.
2. Train advanced ML models on the same dataset.
3. Compare performance metrics (AUC, Gini, KS) to see potential gain.
4. Incorporate top ML insights (e.g., new interaction bins, transformations) into logistic regression.
5. Re-run logistic with expanded feature set, ensuring sign/logical consistency of coefficients.

---

### 6.1.3 Segmented Modeling Approach

As introduced earlier:

1. **Kooti Pro Score (Thick-File)**
    - Emphasizes **traditional** logistic regression.
    - Minimal ML usage (mostly for synergy checks or small interaction captures).
    - Focused on standard credit factors (delinquency, utilization, etc.).
2. **Kooti New Score (Thin-File)**
    - **More reliant** on ML enhancements to glean predictive value from limited or alternative data.
    - Heavier usage of tree-based models to identify key patterns in, e.g., telecom or MFS usage.
    - Psychometric data integration, if validated, might also require advanced modeling.

> **Regulatory viewpoint**: The final production engine will remain logistic-based for **transparent** decision-making. ML insights act as **upstream feature engineering** rather than fully replacing logistic regression.

## 6.2 Model Training & Validation Framework

Ensuring robust performance requires a **multi-dimensional** training and testing process. Kooti’s approach includes **data partitioning**, **iterative development**, and **comprehensive validation** to meet global and Bangladesh Bank standards.

---

### 6.2.1 Data Partitioning Strategy

**Proper** data partitioning is critical to guard against overfitting and to check real-world generalization.

1. **Development-Validation-Test Split**
    - **Development Sample**: ~60-70% for initial model building, variable selection, parameter estimation.
    - **Validation Sample**: ~20-30% to monitor performance mid-development, tune hyperparameters, detect overfitting.
    - **Test Sample**: ~10% completely held out until final check.
2. **Time-Based Validation**
    - **Out-of-Time** splits: e.g., train on historical data from 2018-2021, validate on 2022.
    - Ensures the model **performs** well on new cohorts and changing macroeconomic conditions.
3. **Stratified Sampling**
    - Maintain consistent **default rates** across partitions so that each subset is representative.
    - If the default rate is 5% overall, each partition tries to keep around 5% bad borrowers.

**Rationale**: The multi-part approach avoids illusions of performance from testing on data the model has “seen.” This is in line with guidelines from Basel and typical credit bureau practices worldwide.

---

### 6.2.2 Model Training Methodology

#### Feature Preprocessing & Transformation

- **Weight of Evidence (WoE)** for each binned variable: WoEi=ln⁡(%Good in bin i%Bad in bin i). \mathrm{WoE}_i = \ln \Big(\frac{\% \text{Good in bin } i}{\% \text{Bad in bin } i}\Big). Ensures monotonic relationships with log-odds, simplifying logistic regression modeling._
- **Information Value (IV)** to gauge variable predictive strength: 
-IV=∑i=1n(%Gi−%Bi)×ln⁡(%Gi%Bi). \mathrm{IV} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} (\%G_i - \%B_i) \times \ln\Big(\frac{\%G_i}{\%B_i}\Big).
- **Outlier & Missing Handling**: As described in Section 5, large outliers may be winsorized or logged, missing values imputed or binned as “missing.”

#### Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)

Logistic regression is typically fit via **MLE**:

$$L(β)=∏i=1n(piyi×(1−pi)1−yi),L(\beta) = \prod_{i=1}^n \big( p_i^{y_i} \times (1 - p_i)^{1 - y_i} \big),$$

where pip_i is the predicted probability of default for instance ii, and yiy_i is the actual outcome (1=default, 0=non-default). We maximize ln⁡(L(β))\ln(L(\beta)) using iterative methods (Newton-Raphson, IRLS, etc.) until convergence.

**Special Considerations**:

- In **thin-file** contexts, we may use **L2 regularization** (Ridge) or **L1** (Lasso) to avoid overfitting if the data is sparse.
- We **test** multiple binning schemes to ensure stable monotonic relationships.
- Domain knowledge may override purely statistical outputs if a known risk factor is omitted.

#### Significance & Stability Checks

- **Coefficient p-values** (Wald tests) or **likelihood ratio** tests confirm significance.
- **VIF** (Variance Inflation Factor) ensures no severe multicollinearity.
- **Coherence** check: sign of coefficient should match known behavior (e.g., more late payments => higher PD).

---

### 6.2.3 Comprehensive Validation Framework

Validation at **multiple levels** ensures the final model is robust, stable, and regulatorily sound. Kooti uses:

#### 1. Statistical Validation Measures

1. **Discrimination (Ranking)**
    - **Gini Coefficient**: 2×AUC−12 \times \mathrm{AUC} - 1. Typically, ~0.4-0.5+ is good for a bureau model.
    - **KS (Kolmogorov-Smirnov)**: Max difference between good/bad cumulative distributions. Values ~0.3-0.4+ are often considered solid.
    - **AUC (Area Under ROC)**: 0.7-0.8+ indicates good model separation.
2. **Calibration**
    - **Hosmer-Lemeshow**: Compares predicted vs. observed defaults across deciles.
    - **Brier Score**: Mean squared error of predicted probabilities vs. actual outcomes.
    - **Calibration Plots**: Visual to ensure predicted PD aligns with real default rates.
3. **Stability Indices**
    - **Population Stability Index (PSI)**: PSI=∑i=1n(Pval,i−Pdev,i)ln⁡(Pval,iPdev,i), \mathrm{PSI} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} (P_{val,i} - P_{dev,i}) \ln \Big(\frac{P_{val,i}}{P_{dev,i}}\Big), where Pval,iP_{val,i} and Pdev,iP_{dev,i} are proportions in bin ii for validation vs. development sets.
        - PSI < 0.1 => stable, 0.1-0.2 => moderate shift, >0.2 => significant shift.
    - **Characteristic Stability Index (CSI)** if needed at the variable level.

#### 2. Business Validation Approaches

- **Profit/Loss Simulations**: Evaluate financial institutions’ net gains at various score cutoffs.
- **Approval Rate Impact**: How changing score thresholds shifts acceptance volumes.
- **Portfolio Quality**: Vintage-level analyses of how predicted risk matches observed defaults.

#### 3. Regulatory Validation Requirements

- **Model Documentation**: Summaries of data sources, transformations, sign-offs.
- **Fairness & Non-Discrimination**: Testing for bias or disparate impact.
- **Consumer Protection**: Capability to generate reason codes for each denial.
- **Reporting**: Periodic submission of performance metrics to Bangladesh Bank, as mandated.

**Implementation**:

- Typically, we **deploy** the model in a pilot environment, measure real outcomes over a few months, then finalize model cutoffs or refine bins.
- At full rollout, continuous monitoring tracks these validation metrics to ensure stable operation.

### 6.3 Scorecard Development

One hallmark of credit bureaus is delivering **scorecards**—an easily interpretable points system mapping raw logistic outputs to a user-friendly 300–850 scale. This subsection explains the transformation steps and sample band definitions.

---

#### 6.3.1 Scorecard Design Principles

1. **Transparency**: Each variable’s contribution is visible and convertible back to log-odds.
2. **Intuitive Scaling**: Higher scores => lower risk; typical cutoffs (e.g., 650) are easy to interpret.
3. **Implementation Ease**: Lenders can add up characteristic points to get the final score.
4. **Regulatory Compliance**: Scorecards must produce reason codes explaining major negative factors.
5. **Positive/Negative**: Must reflect both positive data (on-time payments) and negative data (late, default).

---

#### 6.3.2 Mathematical Transformation Process

**Three** main parameters define the conversion:

1. **Points to Double Odds (PDO)**: e.g., 20 points = doubling odds of “good.”
2. **Base Score**: e.g., 600 at 1:1 odds (or some default reference).
3. **Offset**: ensures the final scale fits 300–850 range.

Mathematically:

- **Factor** = PDOln⁡(2)\frac{\mathrm{PDO}}{\ln(2)}
- **Offset** = Base Score − (Factor ×ln⁡(BaseOdds))\times \ln(\mathrm{BaseOdds}))

Then the final points for a bin with coefficient β\beta and WoE of WoEb\mathrm{WoE}_b is:

Pointsb=Offset+(Factor×β×WoEb).\text{Points}_b = \text{Offset} + (\text{Factor} \times \beta \times \mathrm{WoE}_b).

**Interpreting**: If a bin is strongly indicative of high default risk, it’ll have a negative total contribution, lowering the final score.

---

#### 6.3.3 Risk Category Mapping

We propose broad bands like:

|Score Range|Risk Category|Approx. Default Probability Example|
|---|---|---|
|750–850|Excellent|<1%|
|700–749|Very Good|1–2%|
|650–699|Good|3–5%|
|600–649|Fair|6–10%|
|550–599|Poor|11–20%|
|300–549|Very Poor|>20%|

**Disclaimer**: Ranges above are purely illustrative. Actual calibration with local data will finalize these breakpoints and associated default probabilities.

---

#### 6.3.4 Hypothetical Scorecard Example: Thick-File Model

A **partial** illustration for Kooti Pro Score might look like:

|Variable|Attribute|Points|Risk Category|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Payment History**|0 delinquencies (past 12 mo)|+85|Excellent|
||1–2 delinquencies|+30|Fair|
||3+ delinquencies|-40|Poor|
|**Credit Utilization**|0–30% usage|+50|Very Good|
||31–70% usage|+20|Good|
||>70% usage|-30|Poor|
|**History Length**|>5 years oldest account|+40|Excellent|
||1–5 years|+10|Fair|
||<1 year|-20|Poor|

> **Illustration Only**: Actual weighting, categories, and cutoffs will be derived from logistic coefficients for Bangladesh data.

---

#### 6.3.5 Hypothetical Scorecard Example: Thin-File Model

For Kooti New Score (using alternative data):

| Variable                         | Attribute                                  | Points | Risk Category |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------ | ------------- |
| **Utility Payment Consistency**  | No missed in last 6 mo                     | +80    | Excellent     |
|                                  | 1–2 missed                                 | +30    | Fair          |
|                                  | 3+ missed                                  | -30    | Poor          |
| **Telecom Payment Reliability**  | No overdue in last 3 cycles                | +60    | Very Good     |
|                                  | 1 overdue                                  | +20    | Fair          |
|                                  | 2+ overdue                                 | -25    | Poor          |
| **Mobile Money Usage**           | ≥10 transactions/month                     | +40    | Good          |
|                                  | 1–9 transactions/month                     | +10    | Fair          |
|                                  | No usage recorded                          | -10    | Poor          |
| **Psychometric Score** (if used) | High conscientiousness indicator (>80%ile) | +25    | Good          |
|                                  | Moderate                                   | 0      | Fair          |
|                                  | Low                                        | -20    | Poor          |
|                                  |                                            |        |               |

Again, these points are **assumptive**. Real data is required to calibrate.

# Section 7: Alternative Data and Psychometric Approaches

The Kooti Credit Bureau methodology expands beyond traditional credit data to incorporate **alternative sources** (utilities, telecoms, mobile financial services, psychometric models) that can help assess risk for thin-file borrowers lacking formal credit histories. This section details the rationale, implementation framework, and performance considerations for these alternative and psychometric approaches.

---

## 7.1 Justification for Alternative Scoring Approaches

### 7.1.1 Addressing the Bangladesh Market Context

1. **Low Formal Credit Penetration**
    
    - In many emerging markets, including Bangladesh, only a fraction of the population has conventional bank-based credit histories.
    - To meet **financial inclusion** goals and accurately score potential borrowers, reliance solely on traditional credit data is insufficient.
2. **Large Unbanked/Underbanked Demographic**
    
    - A substantial portion of the population operates primarily in cash-based or informal channels.
    - **Thin-file** or **no-file** consumers require alternative data sources (telecom bills, utility payments, etc.) to demonstrate creditworthiness.
3. **Regulatory Encouragement**
    
    - Bangladesh Bank guidelines emphasize improved access to credit for underserved segments, aligning with global trends encouraging alternative data usage to expand coverage.
4. **Evidence from Comparable Markets**
    
    - **India**: Telecom and utility data significantly widened the scorable population.
    - **Kenya**: M-Pesa mobile-money usage correlated strongly with loan repayment behavior.
    - **Philippines**: Utility and microfinancing data overcame reliance on limited bank records.

> **Key Insight**: Alternative data can be **80–90%** as predictive as standard credit data in early stages, eventually bridging coverage gaps and enabling robust risk segmentation for millions of previously “invisible” borrowers.

---

### 7.1.2 Global Best Practices & Regulatory Precedent

1. **Global Credit Bureaus**
    
    - FICO XD in the U.S. integrates telecom and utility data for consumers lacking credit records.
    - Experian and Equifax have launched similar alt-data-based scores in emerging regions.
2. **Alliance for Financial Inclusion (AFI)**
    
    - AFI’s policy notes highlight alternative data as a catalyst for inclusive credit markets.
    - Encourages fintech-lender partnerships with mobile operators, utilities, and microfinance networks.
3. **Regulatory Acceptance**
    
    - Many central banks see alternative data as beneficial if privacy and data protection rules are upheld.
    - In Bangladesh, these expansions must comply with existing guidelines (Section 11.4.3 references permissible data sources).

**Takeaway**: By adopting alternative data, Kooti addresses local coverage gaps, aligns with global developments, and conforms to Bangladesh Bank’s objective of fostering inclusive lending.

---

## 7.2 Alternative Data Implementation Framework

To systematically use non-traditional data, Kooti implements a **structured** approach considering both technical feasibility and regulatory constraints.

### 7.2.1 Strategic Data Sourcing & Partnership Approaches

1. **Telecom Data**
    
    - **Postpaid Bill Payments**: Timeliness, arrears, and disconnections.
    - **Prepaid Recharges**: Frequency, amounts, and consistency.
    - **Tenure**: How long the subscriber has maintained the same SIM.
    - **Partnership**: Secure data-sharing agreements with leading operators.
2. **Utility Data**
    
    - **Payment History**: On-time or delayed power/gas/water bills.
    - **Consumption Patterns**: Not necessarily direct for default risk, but sometimes correlated with stable income.
    - **Service Disconnections**: Strong negative signal.
    - **Implementation**: Collaboration with DESCO, BPDB, etc.
3. **Mobile Financial Services (MFS) Data**
    
    - **Transaction Volume**: Frequency, amounts of deposits/withdrawals.
    - **P2P Transfers**: Regular sending/receiving patterns.
    - **Bill Payment**: If MFS is used to pay micro-loans or utility bills.
    - **Partnership**: bKash, Nagad, and other MFS providers.
    - **Risk**: Must ensure user consent and data privacy.
4. **Microfinance Institutions**
    
    - **Small Loan Histories**: Payment performance, group-lending reliability.
    - **Crossover Borrowing**: Checking if borrower is indebted with multiple MFIs.
    - **Data Quality**: May vary widely, so robust standardization is crucial.

**Technical Implementation** involves either **API-based** real-time queries or **secure batch** updates. Partnerships must outline data definitions, refresh intervals, and compliance with consent requirements.

---

### 7.2.2 Data Quality Considerations for Alternative Sources

- **Standardization Challenges**: Telecom vs. utility data may use different nomenclature.
- **Identity Matching**: Must verify that the phone/utility account truly belongs to the individual. National ID cross-checks or fuzzy matching is often required.
- **Timeliness**: Usage/bill updates may be more frequent (weekly/daily) than monthly bank data.
- **Missing & Partial Data**: Some consumers might have multiple phone lines, partial coverage of utility data, etc.
- **Provider-Specific Variation**: Different operators track payment statuses differently. Common data models needed to unify them for scoring.

---

### 7.2.3 Integration with Traditional Data

**Unified Customer View**:

- Combine any existing bank/NBFI credit records with alt data into a single profile.
- For thick-file borrowers, alt data may have **limited** incremental gain if their credit history is already strong.
- For thin-file or no-file borrowers, alt data is **primary** or **only** data source.

**Blending**:

- Weighted approach: If partial credit data is available, the model merges it with alt data.
- Model adjusts emphasis based on data recency, completeness, and historical performance.
- Regular recalibration ensures that if alternative signals degrade (or prove robust), the logistic coefficients reflect it.

---

### 7.2.4 Weighting & Importance Determination

After data is ingested, Kooti evaluates each potential alternative feature’s **predictiveness**:

- **Information Value**: If an MFS usage metric has an IV > 0.1, it’s a strong candidate.
- **Binning & WoE**: As with standard variables, alternative data is binned to transform non-linear relationships.
- **Correlation Analysis**: High overlap with existing variables might lead to merging or selecting only the stronger predictor.
- **Regular Recalibration**: Because alt data usage patterns may evolve over time, these features require more frequent re-checks.

**Caveats**: Coverage gaps exist. Not all consumers use the same operator or pay for electricity in their own name. This partial coverage is still beneficial but must be accounted for in the model’s missing data strategy.

---

### 7.2.5 Potential Limitations & Challenges

1. **Coverage Gaps**: Some rural areas may not have consistent utility records. Many phone lines are registered under a different family member’s name.
2. **Quality & Reliability**: Alternate sources might skip some months, or data might be delayed.
3. **Privacy & Consent**: Strict processes for ensuring data is shared with user permission.
4. **Stability Over Time**: Telecom usage could shift abruptly if the subscriber changes operator.
5. **Bias Potential**: Must ensure alt data doesn’t inadvertently discriminate (e.g., coverage area differences). Thorough fairness checks needed.

Despite these concerns, carefully integrated alternative data significantly broadens coverage and fosters inclusive credit, which aligns strongly with Bangladesh Bank’s policy directives.

---

## 7.3 Psychometric Behavioral Models

For many **thin-file** borrowers, particularly micro-entrepreneurs or those with minimal formal/alternative records, **psychometric assessments** offer additional signals about their likelihood to repay. This approach, used successfully in countries like South Africa, can measure **soft traits** like honesty, diligence, planning orientation, and more.

### 7.3.1 Concept & Rationale

**Psychometric credit scoring** uses standardized questionnaires or gamified tests to evaluate personality traits correlated with repayment behavior. Examples of measured constructs include:

- **Conscientiousness**: Tendency to be organized and diligent.
- **Risk Aversion**: Willingness to avoid defaults.
- **Deliberation**: Thoughtfulness in decision-making.
- **Trustworthiness**: Self-reported or gleaned from consistent responses.

Studies show moderate to strong correlation (0.2–0.4) with actual repayment in microfinance settings, especially for entrepreneurs lacking formal collateral or credit histories.

---

### 7.3.2 Methodology for Psychometric Assessments

1. **Questionnaire Design**
    - Typically 20–50 items measuring multiple scales (e.g., conscientiousness, future orientation).
    - Validated using **pilot** studies in local culture/language.
    - Must avoid sensitive or culturally biased questions.
2. **Response Collection**
    - Could be digital (smartphone app) or interviewer-administered in rural settings.
    - Minimizes guesswork: sometimes timed questions or forced-choice formats to reduce social desirability bias.
3. **Scoring Algorithms**
    - Factor analysis or item-response theory to calibrate question weights.
    - Summarized into 1–3 consolidated psychometric scores (e.g., “Integrity Index”).
    - ML or logistic methods map these scores to default probabilities.
4. **Cultural Adaptation**
    - Local language translations.
    - Testing for consistent factor structures in the Bangladeshi cultural context.
    - Involvement of local psychometric experts and possibly Bangladesh Bank guidelines on consumer data usage.
5. **Statistical Validation**
    - Evaluate how well psychometric scores predict actual default in a pilot subset.
    - Cross-validate with standard features (delinquencies, etc.) to measure incremental gain.

---

### 7.3.3 Integration with Kooti New Score

Because **thin-file** borrowers may not have enough payment records, psychometric data can fill gaps:

- **Weighting**: Psychometric scores might account for 20–30% of the final credit decision input, with the rest from alternative data.
- **Overlapping with Behavior**: If MFS data also indicates strong transaction discipline, that synergy can further lower PD.
- **Model Lifting**: ML may detect specific interactions (e.g., high conscientiousness x stable phone recharges).
- **Ongoing Refinement**: Psychometric items might be updated as we see which traits most strongly correlate with local repayment patterns.

**Implementation** considerations:

1. Logistics: Need staff or digital channels to administer the test.
2. Validation: Must confirm local reliability—some traits might not translate well culturally.
3. Regulatory: Affirm that psychometric data usage is permissible and not infringing consumer privacy.
4. Cost-Benefit: Potentially time-consuming to implement but beneficial for lenders who see drastically improved coverage.

---

## 7.4 Comparative Performance Analysis

### 7.4.1 Predictive Power Comparison

1. **Traditional vs. Alternative**
    
    - Traditional-only: AUC often ~0.72–0.75 for thick-file in other markets.
    - Alternative-only: AUC ~0.65–0.70 in pilot studies for new borrowers.
    - Combined approach: Possibly ~0.75–0.80 even for thin-file groups.
2. **Coverage Advantages**
    
    - Alternative data can score **70%+** of previously unscorable population.
    - Key demographics: rural farmers, new workforce entrants, and micro-entrepreneurs.
    - Empirical studies show default rates often remain manageable when using alt data.
3. **Cost-Benefit**
    
    - Data partnerships require up-front integration costs.
    - Gains: 25–50% more scorable population, improved approval rates, and safer expansion.
    - Socially: fosters financial inclusion, supports microfinance scaling, aligns with Bangladesh Bank goals.

---

### 7.4.2 Implementation Complexity Considerations

- **Tech Integration**: Varied APIs or data submission from utilities and telcos.
- **Ongoing QA**: Must unify frequent updates, handle partial coverage.
- **Staff Training**: Lenders must understand how alt data-based scores differ from typical bureau scoring.
- **Consumer Acceptance**: Some borrowers might be wary of personal data usage if not well explained.
- **Regulatory**: Must ensure privacy standards are upheld, especially for MFS or psychometric data.

---

## 7.5 Segmentation Transition Strategy

A hallmark of Kooti’s approach is **dynamically** classifying each borrower as **thick-file** or **thin-file**. Over time, a borrower who acquires more credit experience transitions from the Kooti New Score to the Kooti Pro Score.

### 7.5.1 Segment Definition Criteria

1. **Thick-file**:
    - ≥2 years of credit history,
    - ≥2 or 3 active credit accounts,
    - Sufficient transaction coverage from mainstream financial institutions.
2. **Thin-file**:
    - <2 years formal credit,
    - Possibly only 1 small loan or no formal records,
    - Relies heavily on alt data (telecom, MFS, etc.)
3. **Edge Cases**: Borrowers with partial credit data but incomplete coverage. A combined approach might be used short-term.

---

### 7.5.2 Transition Mechanisms

- **Graduation Trigger**: Borrower meets thick-file thresholds (e.g., 2 active credit accounts for 12+ months).
- **Data Retention**: Even after transitioning, we keep alt data on file—could still offer secondary insight.
- **Overlap Period**: Possibly calculate both thin-file and thick-file scores for 2–3 cycles (months).
- **Communication**: Lenders see an annotation that “This consumer is transitioning from Kooti New Score to Pro Score.”

**Practical**: Each month, Kooti checks if a previously thin-file borrower now qualifies for thick-file. If yes, we create a partial “Pro Score” and do a **3-month** overlap. Then, the Pro Score permanently replaces the New Score.

---

### 7.5.3 Dual-Score Strategy During Transition

For reliability, we might:

1. **Weighted Blending**
$$FinalScore=w×ProScore+(1−w)×NewScore \text{FinalScore} = w \times \text{ProScore} + (1-w) \times \text{NewScore},$$
    - with w shifting from 0 to 1 over a set transition.
2. **Conservative Approach**
    - If the two scores differ significantly, lenders may opt for the **lower** (more conservative) score, especially for higher loan amounts.
3. **Borrower Education**
    - Provide clarity on why their score or band might jump once they have formal credit history.
    - Emphasize that on-time payments accelerate their move to a “Pro Score” path.

**Implementation**: System flags each borrower monthly, applies the rule-based cutoff, and transitions them if stable. This ensures no abrupt changes unless data strongly supports it.

1. **Dual-Model Segmentation**
    - **Kooti Pro Score** specifically addresses thick-file borrowers who possess sufficient formal credit histories.
    - **Kooti New Score** caters to thin-file or no-file borrowers, leveraging alternative data (utility, telecom, mobile financial services) and psychometric insights where available.
2. **Comprehensive Data Utilization**
    - Incorporates **traditional financial data** from banks, NBFIs, MFIs, and insurance providers.
    - Leverages **alternative data** such as telecom usage, utility bill payments, MFS transactions, and optional psychometric assessments.
    - Ensures robust data quality management, uniform data standards, and ongoing validation.
3. **Robust Validation and Governance**
    - Employs a multi-dimensional validation framework (statistical, business, and regulatory) ensuring that models consistently meet performance thresholds.
    - Embeds a structured governance model with a **Model Oversight Committee**, regular performance reviews, and a robust dispute resolution process for consumers.
4. **Flexible Technical Implementation**
    - Model architectures accommodate both **batch** and **real-time** scoring.
    - Scalable infrastructure designed to handle large volumes of consumer data, with the option for advanced ML-based refinements.
    - Segmentation transition strategies ensure borrowers move seamlessly from thin-file to thick-file classifications as their credit histories evolve.
5. **Regulatory Alignment**
    - All processes, from data collection to scoring output, adhere to permissible purposes, data privacy rules, and consumer protection standards defined by **Bangladesh Bank**.
    - Fair lending principles and explicit bias checks are embedded throughout the methodology to maintain transparency and public trust.

Taken together, these elements demonstrate a holistic credit scoring framework that can meaningfully expand financial inclusion, reduce information asymmetry, and support robust risk management across the Bangladesh credit ecosystem.
